# Task 8: Stored Procedures & Functions  
**SQL Developer Internship – Task 8**

## 🎯 Objective  
Learn how to modularize SQL logic using **Stored Procedures** and **Functions**.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- MySQL Workbench  
- (Optional) DB Browser for SQLite — *but SQLite does NOT support stored procedures/functions*

## 📘 What I Did  
- Created sample tables (Customers, Orders, OrderDetails)
- Wrote **one stored procedure** with parameters
- Wrote **one user-defined function**
- Used IF conditions inside SQL routines
- Executed and tested procedures and functions
- Included screenshots + SQL file (`task8.sql`)

## 🧾 Stored Procedure Example  
- Procedure to get total spending of a customer  
- Procedure accepts customer ID as input  
- Returns total purchase amount  

## 🧮 Function Example  
- Function to calculate total amount for an order  
- Performs aggregation and returns a numeric value  

## 👨‍💻 Files Included  
- `task8.sql` – Complete SQL script  
- `README.md`  
- `screenshots/` folder (proof of execution)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered  
- Difference between procedure and function  
- IN / OUT parameters  
- Returning values using RETURN  
- Calling stored procedures  
- Loops in stored procedures  
- Scalar vs table-valued functions  
- What is a trigger (concept)  
- Debugging stored routines  

## 📌 Outcome  
Understanding of reusable SQL logic using stored procedures and functions.

## 🚀 Submission
